            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine soy sauce, lime juice, garlic, sugar, and pepper in a bowl. Taste and adjust to your liking.</li>
                <li>Add the beef to the bowl and mix. Make sure beef slices are coated evenly. Set aside to marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a wok or pan over medium-high heat. Add and fry the onions until edges turn brown. Transfer to a plate.</li>
                <li>Separate the beef from the marinade.</li>
                <li>Fry the beef in batches in the same pan, adding more oil as necessary, until brown and no longer pink in the centers. Transfer to the plate and continue with remaining beef.</li>
                <li>Pour the marinade into the pan with water to deglaze, scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pan using a wooden spoon. Taste and adjust seasonings.</li>
                <li>Place the cooked beef from the plate back to the pan.</li>
                <li>Add half of the onions to the beef and mix them.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat and let simmer until sauce has thickened.</li>
                <li>Serve the beef on a serving plate. Add some sauce on top of it. Garnish with remaining onions and serve.</li>
